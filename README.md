# DA-NBA Advanced Analytics | 2024-25 Season Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a deep dive into the 2024-25 NBA season statistics. It serves as a technical showcase of data integration and interactive storytelling, transforming raw multi-source datasets into an advanced scouting and performance dashboard.

## ⚙️ Data Integration & Modeling
The solution merges three distinct datasets to provide a 360-degree view of player performance:
- **Advanced Stats**: Efficiency ratings (PER), True Shooting (TS%), and Win Shares (WS).
- **Per-Game Stats**: Standard scoring, rebounding, and assist averages.
- **Totals**: Cumulative season performance and durability metrics.

## 📊 Analytical Components
- **Data Transformation**: Complex ETL process to unify different statistical grains (Per-game vs. Totals).
- **Technical Research**: Includes a comparative study on data processing architectures (available in the /docs folder).
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Tools designed to compare player impact across different teams and positions.

## 📂 Repository Structure
